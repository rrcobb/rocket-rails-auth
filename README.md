# authrs

playing with an authenticating proxy in rust

## run

- start the server with `$ cargo run`
- watch server with `cargo watch --why -d 1 -x run` (requires cargo-watch, `cargo install cargo-watch`)

## what, why

- migrating a system piecewise could founder on authentication
- so, nice to test if the authentication-focused rust microservice can work
